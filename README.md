Just a simple binary to help me connect my bluetooth headphones on 42 Paris machines, which has an awfully crowded bluetooth network.


-Change $MAC and $DEVICE_NAME

-Add to default path by

```mv cmf-connect /home/$user/bin/```

-Obviously

```chmod +x /home/$user/bin/cmf-connect```

and then

```cmf-connect```
