Just a simple binary to help me connect my bluetooth headphones on 42 Paris machines, which has an awfully crowded bluetooth network.


1. Change $MAC and $DEVICE_NAME

2. Add to default path

```mv cmf-connect /home/$user/bin/```

3. Obviously

```chmod +x /home/$user/bin/cmf-connect```

4. then *after putting your headphones/earbuds in pairing mode*

```cmf-connect```


PS: Why cmf-connect ? Just because thatś my earbud brand lol
